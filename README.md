## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Scenarios:** Players are presented with realistic email examples and must decide whether each is a phishing attempt or a legitimate message.  
- **Choices:** Players select between "Phishing" or "Legitimate" responses.  
- **Feedback:** Immediate feedback is provided after each selection, explaining why the choice was correct or incorrect.

---

## Pre-Game Training

- **Additional Training Module:** Before gameplay starts, players have a detailed training session where each email scenario is analyzed thoroughly.  
- **Educational Content:** Explains specific phishing indicators (e.g., suspicious links, mismatched email addresses, urgency, unusual requests) and provides best practices for email security.

---

## Time-Based Play

- **Time Limit:** Each scenario can have an optional countdown timer, motivating quick decision-making.  
- **Scoring:** Faster correct decisions yield higher points, encouraging both speed and accuracy.  
- **Penalty:** If the timer expires before a choice is made, the scenario is marked incorrect, emphasizing prompt recognition skills.

## Leaderboard Metrics

- **Scoring System:** Points are awarded based on correct answers and response speed.  
- **Accuracy Tracking:** The leaderboard clearly displays total correct and incorrect answers.

---

## Implementation Details

- **Python-Based:** Easy-to-deploy text interface developed in Python.  
- **Data Storage:** Simple leaderboard metrics stored locally.
